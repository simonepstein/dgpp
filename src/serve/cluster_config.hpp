// Resolved runtime configuration shared by the launcher and server.
//
// The launcher combines a deployment JSON (model, world_size, engine options)
// with site settings from .env. This loader reads the resulting JSON, with
// explicit nodes, ports and paths. nodes[0] is rank 0, which serves HTTP and sends
// effective model/engine settings to peers through the admission journal.
// Peers read bootstrap addresses and local paths from their own files.
//
// Flags after --config override the file. Unknown keys and invalid types
// are errors. Engine defaults match the binary's defaults; deployment
// templates set serving values explicitly. Each rank hashes its effective
// shared configuration, and the warm record checks those hashes before
// serving. See README.md for the schema and deploy/*.example.json for
// templates. Deployment templates must be resolved before this loader reads them.
